# Bike Sales Project

This project is about cleaning Bike Sales data in excel and doing the necessary transformations to help us later in the visualization and find correlation between the amount of bike sales and different variables faster.

## What I did in the project

- Removing dublicates from the data

- Standardizing the Marital status, Gender and the purchased bikes columns for ease of use

- Added Age groups column using a function based on the age to use in Visualization

- Used Pivot tables to find insights on the data 

- Used Dashboards to show the effect of age, gender, income and the commute on purchasing a bike

- Added slicers to further filter the data on other variables if needed
